# Implementation-of-an-Artificial-Neural-Network-on-Xilinx-Vivado-for-Handwritten-Digits-Recognition
Developed Multiplier and Accumulator (MAC), Accumulator (ACC) and integrated with sigmoid IP block in Verilog to implement ANN that can recognize handwritten digits of 8Ã—8 pixels images. The input weight, digit's pixel was provided in hex and passed to MAC which computes summation of weight and pixel value of a digit. Then the output was passed to the Sigmoid function which was implemented using LUT.
